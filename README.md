## Ideas

- Global Dark, Light, and System modes
- Different fonts
- Custom Global theme colors
- Make this whole project about showing off my skills and projects but also about creating somewhere to post my thoughts and ideas aswell as host my online projects
    - Projects such as mini-games, websites, "experiences", experiments, etc...
- Create a blog page with a list of post snippets
    - The blog page could just be an array of AsciiTables, each representing a post
    - Keep improving the AsciiTable library to make it more versatile and customizable
